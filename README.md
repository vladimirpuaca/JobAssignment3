Hi, this project should test the functionality of certain elements on couple of web pages. 

My approach is relatively straightforward, guided by tasks set out in the assignment document. 
However I have 2 things to note:
1) I have not written the ExcelReader class, but I know how to use it.
   This was something provided to the students in the course that I attended and because I've used it in my previous work, I don't consider that I've consulted another person in working on Task3
2) On Task3 I noticed that there are no people with identical names & therefore verified the equivalence of people in Excel Vs Table using only their names.
